A vim plugin that lets you add colored labels to your markdown todo
lists. Also includes a command for adding weekly tasks to the specified
days.

Usage:

    # Today
    - stuff

    # Tuesday
    
    # Always
    - get up

    # All Tuesdays
    - sports

run command :NewWeek (mapped to <Leader>nw)

    # Today
    - stuff
    - get up

    # Tuesday
    - sports

    # Always
    - get up

    # All Tuesdays
    - sports
